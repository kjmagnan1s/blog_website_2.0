title: "About Me"
---

I am a University of Chicago Graduate Student studying social science living and 
studying in the Chicago, IL area.  Previous to the University of Chicago,I studied 
criminal justice and was a police officer.  My passions and drivers have gravitated 
me towards blending my experiences in the criminal justice system and my education 
as a social scientist to apply data driven, evidence based methodology to the field 
of public safety.  

Please use the *Reach Me* links above to contact me via social media outlets.  
You can also see my code and projects I've worked on in school, on my thesis, 
and for fun in the *Projects* section.
