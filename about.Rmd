<br>

I am a University of Chicago graduate student studying social science and living in the Chicago, IL area.  
Previous to the University of Chicago, I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in 
criminal justice and served as a police officer in Missouri.  My carrer interests have gravitated 
me towards blending my experiences in the criminal justice system and my education 
as a social scientist to apply data driven, evidence based methodology to the field 
of public safety.  

Please use the *Reach Me* links above to contact me via social media outlets. You can also see my code and projects 
I've worked on in school, on my thesis, and for fun in the [*Projects*](projects.html) section.
