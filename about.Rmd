a researcher, a data scientist, and a data visualizer. My current role as a Research Manager at the University of Chicago Crime Lab affords me the opportunity to work with exceptionally smart and talented people to improve socioeconomic and safety outcomes of  Chicago residents using data. I have a wonderful partner and when I am not home cooking for her and paying attention to our two cats, we are boarding the next plane to 'somewhere'. I am a culinary curious home chef and love cooking new recipes or old favorites and posting them to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kevin_cooks_chitown/) @kevin_cooks_chitown. Aside from cooking, I am a coffee enthusiast, an avid gamer, and a sci-fi junkie.

During my criminal justice master's degree, I began to learn the extent to which research and data science could be informative and influential in the world. After serving as a Police Officer for a few years, I returned to academia and earned a second master's degree in social science from the University of Chicago. It was here where I began developing my skills as a researcher and a data scientist. During my UChicago education, I also prioritized learning practical skills including coding, data visualization, and GIS analysis. As a Research Manager at the Crime Lab, I have the awesome privilege and responsibility of managing a portfolio of projects with local, state, and federal government agencies and non-profits to reduce violence in Chicago, improve the lives of its residents, especially those disproportionately affected by violence, and develop, test, evaluate, and scale-up projects for other cities.
