# I am ...

a researcher, a data scientist, a crime data enthusiast, culinary curious, coffee lover, and an avid gamer. I am currently a Research Manager at the University of Chicago Crime Lab, where I work with exceptionally smart and talented people to improve socioeconomic and safety outcomes of city residents with data. I have a wonderful partner and when I am not home cooking for her and paying attention to our two cats, we are trying to hop on a plane and explore. I am an enthusiastic home chef and love cooking new recipes or old favorites and posting them to my [Instagram @kevin_cooks_chitown](https://www.instagram.com/kevin_cooks_chitown/)
