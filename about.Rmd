# I am ...
<br>
a researcher, a data scientist, a crime data enthusiast, culinary curious, coffee lover, and an avid gamer. I am currently a Research Manager at the University of Chicago Crime Lab, where I work with exceptionally smart and talented people to improve socioeconomic and safety outcomes of city residents with data. I have a wonderful partner and when I am not home cooking for her and paying attention to our two cats, we are trying to hop on a plane and explore. I am an enthusiastic home chef and love cooking new recipes or old favorites and posting them to my [Instagram @kevin_cooks_chitown](https://www.instagram.com/kevin_cooks_chitown/)

It was during my criminal justice master's degree when I learned how informative and influencial research and data science could be in the world. After serving as a Police Officer for a few years, I returned to academia and earned a master's degree in social science from the University of Chicago where I began developing my skills as a researcher and a data scientist. During my UChicago education, I also prioritized learning practical skills including coding, data visualization, and GIS analysis. As a Research Manager at the Crime Lab, I have the awesome privilege and responsibility of managing a portfolio of projects with local, state, and federal government agencies and local non-profits to reduce violence in Chicago, improve the lives of its residents, and develop, test, evaluate, and scale up projects for other cities.
