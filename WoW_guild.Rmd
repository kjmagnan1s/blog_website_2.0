Having recently started blogging, I realized during my two part YMH blog post that writing and analysis become much easier when they are topics I enjoy (surprise, surprise). Even more, learning and refining my analytical skills is quite entertaining when it's topics I invest my time and energy. With that in mind, I thought what better data to work with next than World of Warcraft Classic.

Now before the the nerd alarms start going off ...

... World of Warcraft Classic ('Classic WoW') is Blizzard Entertainment's recreation of the 2004 critically acclaimed and world's most popular MMORPG game, commonly referred to as World of Warcraft Vanilla. [ ^1^ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) Part of the allure and success of Classic WoW can be directly attributed to its emphasis of social gameplay. In order to complete end-game level content, players must assemble and coordinate massive 25 to 40 person groups through large dungeons or zones, called Raids, within the game, overcoming game mechanics, group role requirements/duties, and leadership challenges all with the reward of powerful end-game items, referred to as "loot". In order to be able to coordinate with 40 other people, in-game organizations, called Guilds, were created for players to socialize and more easily organize towards end-game objectives. 

This is a game I spent much of my childhood playing and I have many, many fond memories of this game. As you can imagine, when Blizzard Entertainment announced Classic Wow, the nostalgic teenager in me could not resist. Even though a lot of things have changed since 2004, the need to find and join a good Classic WoW guild are as important as ever. What I found after joining my guild, Buzz, and running end-game content is that the playerbase of classic WoW is essentially the same as 2004, but 15 years older. Thus, most guilds are comprised of mid-career professionals with children, lifestyles, and far more life experiences who played WoW back in 2004.

This post will explore these differences through data. This story begins a few months ago when our guild began running into some issues with guild management and loot distribution. See, loot in Classic WoW is extremely sought-after, so much so that there are countless stories of guilds completely disbanding over arguments about loot - a 'Google' search of "WoW loot drama" returns 1.9 million results. This led to guilds instituting loot rules or loot systems, such as DKP (Dragon Kill Points), Loot Council, or EPGP (Effort Points/Gear Points). Our guild, for example, decided early on in its formation that EPGP would be our method of loot distribution (I'll cover the elements of EPGP later in this post). When we began end-game content, we utilized a free-to-use EPGP Discord bot. But as of late, this bot has become unreliable and not easily customizable. It was at this point that one of our members skilled in C# coding decided to write a bot personalized to meet Buzz's needs. 

Now that a few months have elapsed since we deployed our own custom bot, I decided this was a great time to utilize a completely tracked EPGP loot system using R and Tableau. My hope is that by keeping this updated, our guild will be able to spend some time learning about how useful this bot one of our members created but also learn a little more about our guild and our data.

Before we proceed, there are probably a few key terms and gaming concepts I should mention:

+ Raid zones in Classic WoW allow for up to 25 players or up to 40 players, depending on the raid. Raids are the main source of EPGP and loot in Classic WoW

+ EPGP is an accounting and tracking system for loot distribution. Participation in raids and other shared guild objectives accrue Effort Points (EP). Acquiring loot or in-game items increases Gear Points (GP). The ratio of Effort Points to Gear Points determine members priority (PR) for loot. The highest players PR determines who receives the loot:

<center>$PR = \frac{EP}{GP}$</center>
<br>

+ The EPGP Bot tracks, among other things, players attendance to Raids, contributions to guild objectives, items awarded to players, and their EPGP history of accruing points. The Buzz bot functions by interacting with Discords REST API services and user input.

+ Effort Points, or EP, are pre-determined amounts for Raid participation. For guild objectives and items, average market in-game cost for these items is converted in EP.

+ Gear Points, or GP, are pre-determined amounts for every item in Classic WoW, primarily based on the items attributes. [ ^2^ ](http://www.epgpweb.com) The exact GP equation for Buzz relies on item value and an items slot value:

<center>$$GP = IV^2 * 0.04 * SV$$</center>

<center>$$
IV = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{(I_lvl - 4)}{2}  if Q \leq 2
\\
\frac{I_lvl - 1.84}{1.6}  if Q \ = 3 
\\
\frac{I_lvl-1.3}{1.3}  if Q \geq 4
\end{cases}$$
</center>
<br>

+ Our guild primarily raids on Sunday and Tuesday nights after the Classic WoW US servers reset and EP points are awarded for guild objective and item donations on Sundays. As a result, any temporal analysis would not produce particularly insightful findings.

+ The EPGP bot has gone through multiple iterations, with new changes and features added over time. This may result in slight inconsistencies across the data, though, the core elements of the bot have remained constant.

+ The EPGP bot has multiple data exporting capabilities. The goal of this blog post is to explore the EPGP data and learn some insights about Buzz.

# Setup and data work

There isn't much work to do here, the EPGP bot's data is fairly clean outside of a chunk of rows that do not have the correct date assigned to their entries. 

```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(            ## load libraries at once, this package is a game changer
               tidyverse,
               lubridate, 
               ggraph,     ## ggplot
               vroom,      ## improved csv reading and in-line piping during load
               reactable,  ## interactive tables
               plotly)     ## interactive plots

## epgp <- vroom("~/GitHub/kjmagnan1s.github.io/blog_data/buzz_epgp_10.16.20.csv")
## loot <- vroom("~/GitHub/kjmagnan1s.github.io/blog_data/buzz_loot_10.16.20.csv")
t_actions <- vroom("~/GitHub/kjmagnan1s.github.io/blog_data/buzz_transactions_10.21.20.csv") %>% 
  mutate(TransactionDate = as.Date(TransactionDateTime, format = '%m/%d/%Y')) %>% ## removing time stamps from date variable
  mutate(TransactionDate = replace(TransactionDate, TransactionDate == "0001-01-01", "2020-08-01")) ## reassigned all incorrectly entered dates to August 1st, it was around this time when these records were assigned this date incorrectly and it was resolved.
  
write.csv(t_actions, file = "~/GitHub/kjmagnan1s.github.io/blog_data/buzz_transactions_clean_10.21.20.csv")

glimpse(t_actions)
```
After chatting with the bot author, he made a new export function for me to get a richer dataset than the ones he programmed for the bot to export ('epgp' and 'loot' commented out above). So now we have 8 columns and just over 16,000 rows data. I'll offer some additional context and data explanation below:

+ DiscordUserID is the ID associated with a user. Because players can play more than one 'character', the bot tracks each of those characters EPGP separately but Discord still tracks unique user ID's. This variable will allow us to track user activity across all their characters.

+ CharacterName is the in-game character name

+ TransactionType describes the EPGP value entry type based on in-game actions. The types are start with either a EP (+) or GP (-) classification followed by the following:

  - EpAutomated: EP awards for participating in raid, automatically assigned based on Raid attributes
  
  - EpDecay: Decay is used as an incentive to use the EPGP system and not hoard PR 
  
  - EpManual: Usually for EP adjustments or awards for in-game guild contributions
  
  - GpDecay: Decay is used as an incentive to use the EPGP system and not hoard PR
  
  - GpFromGear: GP awards for claiming loot/gear with PR
  
  - GpManual: Usually for EP adjustments/corrections
  
With the data cleaning and explanations out of the way, lets explore the EPGP data with some descriptive analyses in {r} before moving into an interactive Tableau Public dashboard.

# Descriptives

```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
t_actions %>% 
  filter(TransactionType == "GpFromGear") %>%
  group_by(CharacterName, Memo, TransactionDate) %>%
  summarise(Value) %>%
  filter(Value > 15) %>%                              ## avoids any of the [Rolls], we'll cover those later
  reactable(defaultSorted = list("Value" = "desc"))

# ggplotly(t_actions %>%
#   group_by(TransactionDate, TransactionType, Value) %>%
#   filter(TransactionDate > "2020/07/01") %>%
#   ## filter(TransactionType %in% c("EpAutomated", "GpFromGear")) %>%
#   ggplot(aes(month(TransactionDate), Value, fill = TransactionType)) +
#   geom_col(position = "dodge") +
#   labs(
#     title = "Transactions Over Time",
#     x = "Transaction Month",
#     y = "Count"
#   )
# )
```

Some interesting findings in this table. I was really looking to see which character/player claimed the highest GP valued loot. Turns out it was a tie at 301 GP to Phanon for Ashkandi <img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_sword_50.jpg" width= 25px height= 25px> and Banesoul for Staff of the Shadow Flame <img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_staff_06.jpg" width= 25px height= 25px> which ironically both drop from the boss Nefarian in Blackwing Lair (BWL). I also found it interesting most of the items claimed at the top of the list occurred very recently, within the past 2 months even though the top 2 items for GP were claimed from BWL which we have been raiding for months.

This is probably a good time to mention that the character I play is Okara (don't ask, was the name I randomly chose back in Vanill), seen on this list near the top for claiming the Blessed Qiraji Augur Staff <img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_staff_20.jpg" width= 25px height= 25px> for 286 GP.

Lets take this table view and make a plot of the top 20 items claimed, just to look at it visually instead:

```{r}
## to do:
## bar chart month by month ep accrued and gp spent ??

ggplotly(
  t_actions %>%
  filter(TransactionType == "GpFromGear") %>%
  mutate(Memo = str_remove_all(Memo, c("\\]|\\["))) %>%
  distinct(TransactionType, Memo, Value) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = Value, n = 20) %>%
  mutate(Memo = str_remove_all(Memo, "Claim")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Memo, Value, .desc = TRUE), y = Value, text = paste(
    "<br> Item:", Memo,
    "<br> GP Amount:",Value))) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
    labs(
    title = "Top Loot for GP",
    x = NULL,
    y = "GP Amount"
  ), tooltip = "text"
  #layout(yaxis = list(categoryyorder = "category descending"))
)
```

Right so nothing really jumps out at me here. The GP values are ever so slightly skewed to the right, indicating a smooth reduction in GP cost. One important note that any WoW player would catch onto, the top 20 list here are all weapons. In the EPGP system, weapons are normally the most sought after item and come with the highest GP values. 

Thus far, we've briefly discussed EPGP as a loot distribution system. In order to gain EP, a player needs to either attend guild events or contribute in-game materials to the guild. These in-game materials require a player to spend time gathering the item or spend gold to buy the item and donate it to the guild. We've looked at some ways players spend GP, so let's look at some of the ways players gain EP.

```{r}
ggplotly(
  t_actions %>%
  filter(TransactionType %in% c("EpAutomated", "EpManual")) %>% 
  select(CharacterName, Value, TransactionType) %>%
  group_by(CharacterName, TransactionType) %>%
  summarise(Value = sum(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(TransactionType) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = Value, 
            n = 20,
            with_ties = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(CharacterName, Value, .desc = TRUE), 
             y = Value, 
             fill = TransactionType, 
             text = paste(Value, "total EP awarded for", TransactionType))) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75)) +
    labs(
    title = "Top EP By Character",
    x = NULL,
    y = "EP Amount"
    ), tooltip = "text"
)
```
