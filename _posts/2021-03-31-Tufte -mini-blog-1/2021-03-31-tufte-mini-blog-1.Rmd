title: "Lessons learned from Tufte: Sparklines and datawords"
description: |
  Using design theories and examples from Tufte's books, this mini-blog series will explore real world examples of my interpretation and inclusion of Tufte's teachings into my work.
  
  In this post, I explore a somewhat familiar topic of combining numbers and words in relevant context and space.

## Background

In my pursuit of professional growth and skill development, I have recently turned to design theory, visualization best practices, and authors who are held in high regard for these principles. One such author I have particularly enjoyed is Edward Tufte. After reading "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information", I was left with a dozen or so bookmarks of charts and visualization examples to replicate or incorporate into future work. Leveraging my backing in Tableau and R (& my growing skills in Power BI) and a wealth of data viz opportunities from community challenges including \#MakeoverMonday, \#RWFD, and \#TidyTuesday, I thought this would be a perfect excuse to incorporate the lessons learned from Tufte into my work, blog about the development of visualizations, and reflect on the practicality and use-case of each particular lesson from Tufte (and others!).

## Sparklines and Datawords

For the seasoned data analyst or data visualizer out there, I will venture to guess the concept of sparklines and datawords will not be a foreign concept. While the term Tufte uses may be new, this type of visual goes by many names (for example: callout numbers, callout boxes, dashboard cards, visual annotations) and is ubiquitous with business dashboards and sporting visuals, to name a few. What I found compelling from Tufte's writing was the extent to which these visuals can derive meaning, capitalize on context, and push the boundaries of data presentation within a relatively small footprint. I'll go into detail on what I mean by this in the next section.

At its core, sparklines and datawords are, as Tufte puts it, "data-intense, design simple, word-sized graphics". Sparklines and datawords can simply compliment a textbox or act as standalone visual to call attention to a single measurement, but they can also be used as a comprehensive visualization in the form of a small multiples visual or combined with a large table of data.

When I encountered this concept in Tufte's book, I knew I wanted to capitalize on the effectiveness of sparklines and design an entire dashboard around this idea. Fortunately, \#MakeoverMonday's weekly challenge covered global cash crops and the dataset provided had a variety of contextually relevant and interconnected dimensions. Additionally, Tufte provided a example of a visualization on forecasting economic indices in his book (page 180) with a template which I found to be perfect for this week's \#MM challenge.

After close examination, this visual has a few important characteristics I plan to replicate in a Tableau dashboard. Namely:

* Some kind of baseline or average value/dataword established across all dimensions (i.e. the black panel)
* Columns of datawords arranged ascending/descending based off the baseline value - in this example, based off how close they were to the baseline forecast
* Standardized containers for each dimension and value across the visual
* Descriptions or legends placed organically in blank areas caused by the arrangement of the datawords


## Building a sparkline and dataword dashboard

Up until now, I have covered the why, the what, and the so what; now we will cover the how.

Taking advantage of the global cash crops dataset posted to [dataworld](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w11) for \#MakeoverMonday, we can begin building this dashboard, making sure to incorporate as many of the observations from the visual Tufte included in his book above.

The global cash crops dataset provides an advantageous structuring of this data for our intended visualization. We have a region column for 5 of the 6 continents (excluding Antarctica) plus a global category, an element column describing the type of crop resource measured, a year column and value column (including a unit of measure). Thus, we can arrange the columns based on element (crop production, harvest, and yield) broken up by region, and described by year and value/unit. Additionally, while no baseline or target to compare regions was provided, we can compare each region against the global value (more importantly, against the global percent change).
